    "Chicago is a large metropolitan city with 77 communities. It's a popular tourist spot in the US and is home to several businesses, restaurants and entertainment options. However, it's one thing to visit such a large city as a tourist and it's another to move permanently and start living especially when you have limited knowledge about the city. This data science project is aimed at assisting people find a suitable community in Chicago that meets their requirements.\n",

    "There are several factors that one considers when looking for a place they can call home - Accessibilily to restaurants, convenience and grocery stores, public transporation, schools and equally important factors such as costs and crime rates etc. In this project, we will lay the foundation for a methodology to make data driven decisions while considering crime rates and also access to popular amenities such as restaurants, shops etc. The idea is to find an ideal location which offers all the amenities one is looking for while choosing a community with a low crime rate per capita."

This data will be used to create a pandas dataframe with a mapping of the community number to the community name. The community names will then serve as inputs to extract geospatial coordinates.
